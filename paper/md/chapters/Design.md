# Design

In this chapter the design of the application will be discussed.

First the following questions will be answered us
ing sequence-diagrams:

- How will processes announce their presence to the synchronization-server?
- How will the processes be synchronized by the synchronization-server?

Thereafter the functionality of the system will be further explained using a class-diagram.

And lastly the FSP diagram will be provided and explained for the system.

## Sequence-diagrams

### How will processes announce their presence to the synchronization-server
The sequence-diagram for a process announcing their presence to the synchronization-server is as following:
