For the implementation for this paper Minix 3.1.8 will be used. Minix
will run inside VirtualBox version 5.0.40\_Ubuntu r115130.

The whole implementation will be written in the programming language C.

The implementation interaction with the outside world will be through
the standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) of the
command-line interface (CLI).
