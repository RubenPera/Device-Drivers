In year 4 of the study Applied computer science at InHolland University
of applied science students will do a project called Realtime \&
Embedded systems. For this project students will build a realtime system
that is based upon an FSP design.

A FSP design means that the system will consist of multiple threads that
have the following attributes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The current state
\item
  A set of states, Transition-table
\item
  A set of action it can execute, Alphabet
\item
  A set of actions it can execute from the current state,
  Sensitivity-list
\end{itemize}

When an action is executed by this thread a state transition occurs. The
threads are synchronized based upon their action, synchronization is
done by the synchronization-server.

This paper focuses on designing and implementing this system in the
programming language C.
