\chapter{Test}\label{test}}

In this application different aspects will be tested.

\hypertarget{ltsa-model}{%
\section{LTSA model}\label{ltsa-model}}

The LTSA model will using the LTSA desgin tool safety, progress and
supertrace tests.

\hypertarget{safety}{%
\subsection{Safety}\label{safety}}

Using the safety test of LTSA design tool the following output is
produced:

\includegraphics{../img/safety.png}

\hypertarget{progress}{%
\subsection{Progress}\label{progress}}

Using the progress test of LTSA design tool the following output is
produced:

\includegraphics{../img/progress.png}

\hypertarget{supertrace}{%
\subsection{Supertrace}\label{supertrace}}

Using the supertrace test of LTSA design tool the following output is
produced:

\hypertarget{the-minix-implementation}{%
\section{The minix implementation}\label{the-minix-implementation}}

When running the implementation on Minix it produces the following
output:

\includegraphics{../img/output.png}

Here the character 'w' and 'd' where read from the input line. This
output is one of the possible traces that can be followed from the FSP
model, and was tested in LTSA tools:

This concludes that the application build can follow from an FSP design,
as this was the aim of this paper.
