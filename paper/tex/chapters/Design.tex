\section{Design}\label{design}}

In this chapter the design of the application will be discussed.

First the class diagram will be discussed, thereafter the sequence
diagrams illustrating key operations, and lastly the LTS model for the
application that will be build in this paper.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  FiniteStateMachine, implementation of the finite-state machine
\item
  FiniteStateMachineNode, implementation of the finite-state machine
  that can communicate with the synchronization-server
\item
  FiniteStateMachineNodeStatus, container used for sending the status of
  a finite-state machine to the synchronization-server
\item
  FiniteStateMachineNodeDerivative, container used for storing
  finite-state machine data by the synchronization-server
\item
  SynchronizationServer, implementation of the synchronization-server
  that can communicate with the finite-state machines
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sequence-diagrams}{%
\subsubsection{Sequence-diagrams:}\label{sequence-diagrams}}

Two sequence-diagrams will illustrate:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How will processes announce their presence to the
  synchronization-server?
\item
  How will the processes be synchronized by the synchronization-server?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{concurrent-model}{%
\subsection{Concurrent model}\label{concurrent-model}}

In this paper the goal is not to implement an advanced concurrent model,
the aim is to implement FSP based design in Minix, therefore a simple
FSP and LTS model is used.

The aim of this concurrent model is to control a simulated car, the
input is read from stdin, the corresponding direction is determined and
written to stdout.

\hypertarget{fsp-model}{%
\subsubsection{FSP model}\label{fsp-model}}

THe FSP model is as following:

\begin{verbatim}
set Keys = {w, a, s, d}
set Directions = {forward, left, back, right} 

                // Drivers
STDIN_DRIVER = (check_stdin_value -> Keys -> STDIN_DRIVER).
STDOUT_DRIVER = (Directions -> write_stdout -> STDOUT_DRIVER).


                // Thread
CONTROLLER = (w -> forward -> CONTROLLER 
                    | a -> left -> CONTROLLER 
                    | s -> back -> CONTROLLER
                    | d -> right -> CONTROLLER).

||DRIVERS = (STDIN_DRIVER || STDOUT_DRIVER).

||THREADS = (CONTROLLER).

||COMBINED = (DRIVERS || THREADS).
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{explanation}{%
\paragraph{Explanation}\label{explanation}}

The Explanation for each of the FSP elements:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  STDIN\_DRIVER, reads from stdin the values that are withing the Keys
  set.
\item
  STDOUT\_DRIVER, writes values from the Direction set to the stdout.
\item
  CONTROLLER, maps the values from the Keys set to the Directions set.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{LTS Model}\label{lts-model}}

The LTS models is as following:
